  <p></p>
    <p>TBT is a social project.</p>
    <p>Today, many people would like to get help or advice, but they canâ€™t do it because of different situations.</p>
    <p>TBT will allow you to anonymously post a topic of your problem and a brief description. It will be called an ISSUE.</p>
    <p>Also only one person can join to your issue anonymously.</p>
    <p>You can talk about anything without fear of publicity or public censure.</p>
    <p>If you do not like the person you are talking to, we recommend that you recreate the issue.</p>
    <p>After closing the issue, all data about it will be deleted once and for all.</p>
    <p></p>
